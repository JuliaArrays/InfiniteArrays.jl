# InfiniteArrays.jl

A Julia package for representing arrays with infinite dimension sizes, designed to work
with other array types. Infinite arrays are by necessity lazy, and so this
package is closely linked to [LazyArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/LazyArrays.jl).

The package currently supports construction, but future versions will include
support for linear algebra operations like matrix multiplication, LU decompositions,
and QR decompositions.


Here are some examples of current functionality:

```julia
julia> using InfiniteArrays, LinearAlgebra

julia> x = Ones(∞) # infinite vector of all ones
Ones{Float64,1,Tuple{InfiniteArrays.OneToInf{Int64}}} with indices OneToInf():
